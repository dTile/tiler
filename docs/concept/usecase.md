<h3>How can tiling help in mapping applications</h3>
<p>
Perimeter areas help alert contain, respond and alert on a disaster event like fire, floods or a dam collapse.
A tiled perimeter is better than the conventional geographical response team partitioning that depends on county boundaries and that does't cover same size areas.  Making some perimeters bigger 2 or more times bigger than other response or evacuation areas.
The use of tiled perimeters has the following benfits:
<ol>
  <li>Overcoming the need of calculatomg coordinates of all tiles in a drill down level for showing a grid on a map or for extracting tiles to a geoJSON object.</li>
  <li>Enabling the use of matrices that are any combination of tiles accordingly with a resolution (granularity) level.</li>
  <li>Using tiles that have similar sizes to their adjacent neighbours</li>
  <li>Assigning properties or colors to tiles which enables easier understaning and proximity evaluation to response teams and affected persons or systems</li>
</ol>

<h3>Use Case - Eaton Fire</h3>
A geoJSON map delims tha area of the Eaton Fire that took place in California. 
The map is available at [https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/](https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::ca-perimeters-cal-fire-nifc-firis-public-view/explore)
and the corresponding [geoJSON](https://dtile.github.io/tiler//media/firisEaton.json) file can be suppoerimposed on a a mapping application.
